"It was a stroke of luck to have Binay Sir as my mathematics teacher while I was preparing for the IIT JEE examination. I am immensely grateful for the exceptional guidance and teaching provided by him.
</p>
<br>
<p>
He seamlessly transitioned from foundational topics to advanced mathematical problems, ensuring a gradual and thorough progression. This approach played a crucial role in building a comprehensive understanding of the subject and in laying a solid groundwork before moving on to more intricate concepts.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The quality of illustrations and explanations provided were more than sufficient to develop a strong base in mathematics. His teaching methodology helped clarify even complex ideas with ease.

"I was a student of Binay Sir during my +2 studies at RKMV, Deoghar. I have nothing but fond memories from his classes.

The ease with which he broke down complex and intimidating calculus problems was inspiring, to say the least. His calm and methodical approach made even the toughest topics feel approachable.

His attitude of not getting fazed by seemingly difficult concepts and instead looking at them objectively has stayed with me through the years and continues to influence my way of thinking.

      <h2>Raj Karmhe</h2>
<p>
"Respected Binay Sir,
</p>
<br>
<p>
I am Raj Karmhe, currently pursuing B.Tech in Chemical Engineering at IIT Indore. I come from Deoghar, a tier-4 city, where quality coaching facilities for JEE and NEET preparation are extremely limited and only a handful of students manage to crack these highly competitive examinations.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Coming from such a background, qualifying JEE Main and JEE Advanced initially seemed like a distant dream. However, with your guidance and the constant support of Pranay Sir, this goal gradually became achievable.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I successfully cleared both JEE Main and JEE Advanced, securing 98.22 percentile in my first JEE Main attempt, 99.12 percentile in my second attempt, and an All India Rank of 10,446 in JEE Advanced. The steady improvement in my performance reflects the strong academic foundation, discipline, and confidence that both of you helped build.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Your teaching methodology in Mathematics is truly exceptional. The emphasis on solving a large number of problems during class strengthened my concepts and significantly improved my problem-solving ability and exam temperament.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Similarly, Pranay Sir’s approach to teaching Physics played a crucial role in my preparation. His focus on conceptual clarity, use of relatable examples, and dedication to ensuring deep understanding made Physics both enjoyable and scoring. The additional sessions for competitive-level problems further enhanced my confidence.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I firmly believe that reaching IIT Indore from a tier-4 city like Deoghar would not have been possible without the combined mentorship, effort, and dedication of both you and Pranay Sir. You are not only outstanding educators but also true mentors who inspire students to aim higher and believe in themselves.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I will always remain grateful for your guidance and support.
</p>
<br>
<p>
With sincere respect,<br>
