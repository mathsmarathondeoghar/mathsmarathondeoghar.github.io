  “A teacher who positively affected my attitude toward education was my math teacher, 
  Sir Binay Narayan Khaware. He made math easy by explaining the problems clearly as well 
  as by giving shortcuts to solve problems.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Additionally, he gave me confidence in my ability to do math as well as methods to use 
  in the future. I believe he has positively affected my attitude towards education because 
  he is an example of a good teacher who has helped students improve their math skills.
</p>
<br>

  Binay Narayan Khaware Sir made math simple by giving his students quicker ways to do 
  problems. He also worked out the problems on the board step by step which made it easier 
  to learn.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  When it comes to math I’m a visual learner and I need a detailed explanation. In 
  addition, he explained everything clearly and was always willing to help his students.
</p>
<br>

  Furthermore, while I was in his class I felt more confident in my math abilities.

Binay sir guided me both during my days as a student of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith and beyond, especially in the field of Mathematics. His initial guidance helped me to develop an interest in Maths, and that interest motivated me to pursue Maths in the years to follow.
         <br><br>
         I successfully cracked JEE Advanced and graduated in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT–Bombay in 2019. I continued my passion for Maths by taking it as my optional subject for the  UPSC Civil Services Examination (2021) and cracked it with a rank of AIR-26.

   "In an education system that often prioritizes memorization, Sir Binay Narayan Khaware
   stood out by emphasizing reasoning and deep understanding. He focused on helping us
   comprehend the “why” behind mathematical concepts rather than merely memorizing formulas.
</p>

<p>
   This approach made a significant difference in my learning experience and helped me
   develop critical thinking skills. His step-by-step explanations and willingness to
   support students gave me confidence in my mathematical abilities.

   I believe teachers like Binay Sir are rare and invaluable — not only in shaping students
   academically, but also in nurturing them as critical thinkers. I am truly grateful for
   the opportunity to have learned under his guidance.

"To my beloved teacher, Binay Sir,
</p>
<br>
<p>
I am writing to express my profound gratitude for the incredible impact you have had on my life and learning. You saw potential in me long before I could see it in myself, and your unwavering belief in me became a catalyst for embracing bigger dreams and aspirations.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I will always be grateful for your patience and guidance at every step of my journey. Your approach to teaching made learning both enjoyable and deeply understandable, always delivered with a personal and thoughtful touch.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Above all, it is your kindness, constant support, and steadfast commitment to my success that I will remember the most. These qualities made a lasting difference in my academic and personal growth.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Thank you for believing in me and helping me believe in myself. You are truly one of a kind.
</p>

"I was a student of Binay Sir during my +2 studies at RKMV, Deoghar. I have nothing but fond memories from his classes.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The ease with which he broke down complex and intimidating calculus problems was inspiring, to say the least. His calm and methodical approach made even the toughest topics feel approachable.
</p>
<br>
<p>
His attitude of not getting fazed by seemingly difficult concepts and instead looking at them objectively has stayed with me through the years and continues to influence my way of thinking.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I will forever remain grateful to him for his mentorship and guidance.
